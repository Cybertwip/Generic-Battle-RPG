- Failed to Pull the pruned Master branch, so I discarded my local repo and did an HTTPS clone via the command line.
- Afterwards, I immediately made this new branch via GitHub Desktop.
- Merged Luigi's animation controlers.
- Rewrote the animation controller logic so that it is handled by an int parameter in the controller. Rewrote `LuigiAnimEvents.cs` to accomodate these changes.
- Deleted unneeded Luigi model, animation assets.
- Noticing frequent crashes, sporadic errors about missing assets or memory locations. This may have something to do with version disparity for packages. It could also be because I suck at GitHub. Otherwise, everything has been improved.
